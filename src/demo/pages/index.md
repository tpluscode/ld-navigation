Welcome to sample page for the [ld-navigation][gh] repository. It contains two simple elements,
which can be used to manage the application state by tracking HTTP API's resource URLs.

Go ahead and click the menu elements on the left to see them in action.

**TL;DR;** the elements are:

## `<ld-navigator>`

Allows you to bind and observe the resource URL, while maintaining history
([HTML5 history API][history] or [hash][useHash]) and rewrites browsers URL for nicer
client addresses.

## `<ld-link> <a/> </ld-link>`

Wraps anchor so that state transitions are possible
